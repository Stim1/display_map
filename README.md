# Map Marker Application

This application enables users to interact with a Google Maps interface by placing numbered markers on the map. Each marker is automatically assigned a unique sequential number and can be moved or removed. The application integrates with Firebase to persistently store the location data for each marker.

## Features
- Place markers on the map with a simple click.
- Drag and drop markers to update their location.
- Remove individual markers or clear all markers from the map.
- Sequential numbering for each marker for easy identification.
- Real-time data storage with Firebase.

## Technologies Used
- **Google Maps API**: For rendering maps and handling map-related operations.
- **Firebase**: To store and retrieve marker data in real-time.
- **TypeScript**: For adding static type definitions to JavaScript, increasing the robustness of the code.
